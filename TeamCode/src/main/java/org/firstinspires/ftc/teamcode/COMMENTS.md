Our intake was originally lego wheels
Changed to compliant wheels
Arm, went fom 2 bars to one
added guide wheels
Moved arms back for stability and easier pickup
Ballast for stability and balance

Fangs - foundation grabbers
Original design, looked like snake fangs
surgical tubing, Didn't hold well
Plate design holds better, uses grip tape

Wiring was a mess originally
Cleaned up and added labels

Two controllers for dirvers
C1 does main driving

Custom parts for the team
Fusion 360
Learned from an FRC team member
Original ones broke, so we went through multiple designs

Originally used Blocks programming
moved to Java
Use tank drive
Added a custom class for the hardware, shared between opmodes

Original auto was just driving forward to the line
wanted to get a block and park on the line

Made simple steps that use those function
